                        Containerized applications can run in various server
                        environments, including cloud services, providing a

                        containers and cloud services efficiently can be cheaper
                        than traditional setups.

                        Containers and microservices let you work on new
                        features separately. This makes it easier to create,

                        pipelines automate code verification and build
                        processes, streamlining error detection and reducing
